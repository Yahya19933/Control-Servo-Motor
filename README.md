# Control-Servo-Motor
Control servo motor up to 16 motors by using PCA9685 Module PWM

## Control 3 servo motors by one Arduino UNO
When control 3 motors by one Arduino UNO connect the signal wires to digital PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pins which mark by ~

## Control up to 16 servo motors by one Arduino UNO
In case want to control up to 16 motors in one Arduino. Must connect with PCA9685 module which offers up to 16 channels of PWM pins

In this animation, the servo increases 10 degrees incrementally for each servo motor
